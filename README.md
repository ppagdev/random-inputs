The windows script is using code from https://github.com/DougDougGithub/TwitchPlays
This is no longer necessary and the linux script should work on windows as well because of the awesome work at https://github.com/gauthsvenkat/pyKey however I don't currently have windows on any of my machines so I can't test it so it's staying like this for now.
